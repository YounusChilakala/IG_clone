# IG_clone
This project is done to analyze the patterns/trends in an application like Instagram; 
for which we've built a clone of the app albeit of a much smaller scale to mimic 
the most popular functionalities of the app such as likes, shares and comments etc. 

The project the answers questions such as the users who liked the most photos, users
with the highest like count and those who never posted a single photo on the platform and so on. 
The entire project is done in MySQL.
